 do you see the change?
 
This project goal is to predict the sentiment on a corpus of tweets as positive or negative, to allow for further analysis. An app was published for users to select the best model and apply it to a new set of tweets.
 
The app works as follows:
 
1 - Train three different algorithms and optimise them to get the best models for each one.

2 - Select the best model to analyse the sentiment in a new set of tweets.

3 - Get a preview of the results and download the csv file with labelled tweets.
 
## 1 - Corpus

## 2 - Model selection

## 3 - Application
