 do you see the change?
 
This project goal is to predict the sentiment on a corpus of tweets as positive or negative, to allow for further analysis. An app was published for users to select the best model and apply it to a new set of tweets. It includes bulding a corpus of labelled tweets, selecting models to compare and allow users to select the most performant model via a web app.

## 1 - Corpus

The model will be trained on a set of 1220 tweets labelled as positive or negative. The corpus is built by collating a list of labelled IDs with the corresponding tweet text, via the Twitter API.

## 2 - Model selection



## 3 - Application



The app works as follows:
 
1 - Train three different algorithms and optimise them to get the best models for each one.

2 - Select the best model to analyse the sentiment in a new set of tweets.

3 - Get a preview of the results and download the csv file with labelled tweets.
